    "### Querying\n",
    "Above, we just used the `to_pandas()` method on each table in the dataset to see an example of the data that is in each table. The underlying query engine for TEEHR is PySpark.  As a result, each of the table sub-classes can return data as either a Spark DataFrame (using the `to_sdf()` method) or as a Pandas DataFrame (using the `to_pandas()` method).  The location data tables have an additional method that returns a GeoPandas DataFrame (using the `to_geopandas()` method) where the geometry bytes column has been converted to a proper WKT geometry column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: PySpark itself is \"lazy loaded\" meaning that it does not actually run the query until the data is needed for display, plotting, etc.  Therefore, if you just use the `to_sdf()` method, you do not get the data but rather a lazy Spark DataFrame that can be used with subsequent Spark operations that will all be evaluated when the results are requested.  Here we show how to get the Spark DataFrame and show the data but there are many other ways that the lazy Spark DataFrame can be used in subsequent operations that are beyond the scope of this document."

If you did `len(ev.primary_timeseries.to_pandas())`, first the entire data frame would have to be loaded in memory as a Pandas DataFrame and then the length calculated.  On the otherhand, if you were to `ev.primary_timeseries.to_sdf().count()` the Spark engine would calculate the number of rows without loading the entire dataset into memory first.  For larger datsets this could be very important."
