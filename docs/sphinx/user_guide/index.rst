User Guide
==========

The best way to get to know TEEHR is by working through each of the User Guide pages below.
Each page in this section is a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates some aspect of TEEHR.
The User Guide is designed to be interactive, so you can download the notebooks and run the code to see the results for yourself.

Before starting, make sure you have installed TEEHR and its dependencies as described in the :doc:`Getting Started </getting_started/index>` section.

.. note::
   The pages below are Jupyter notebooks that also make up many of the pages in the User Guide that contain executable code.
   You can view the content in the User Guide pages, but you will need to download the notebooks to run the code yourself.
