The best way to get to know TEEHR is by working through each of the examples in this User Guide.
Each page in this section is a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates some aspect of TEEHR.
The user guide is designed to be interactive, so you can download the notebooks and run the code to see the results for yourself.

Before starting, make sure you have installed TEEHR and its dependencies as described in the :doc:`Getting Started </getting_started/index>` section.
