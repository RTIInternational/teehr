# TEEHR - Tools for Exploratory Evaluation in Hydrologic Research
TEEHR (pronounced "tier") is a python tool set for loading, storing,
processing and visualizing hydrologic data, particularly National Water
Model data, for the purpose of exploring and evaluating the datasets to
assess their skill and performance.

NOTE: THIS PROJECT IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT - EXPECT TO FIND BROKEN AND INCOMPLETE CODE.

## Documentation
[TEEHR Documentation](https://rtiinternational.github.io/teehr/)

## How to Install TEEHR (macOS/Linux)
We do not currently push TEEHR to PyPI, so the easiest way to install it is directly from GitHub.
If using `pip` to install TEEHR, we recommend installing TEEHR in a virtual environment.
Detailed installation instuctions for macOS/Linux users are available [here](https://rtiinternational.github.io/teehr/getting_started/index.html#installation-guide-for-macos-linux) under 'Installation Guide for macOS & Linux'.

## How to Install TEEHR (Windows)
Currently, TEEHR dependencies require users install on Linux or macOS. To use TEEHR on Windows, we recommend Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Detailed installation instructions for Windows users are available [here](https://rtiinternational.github.io/teehr/getting_started/index.html#installation-guide-for-windows) under 'Installation Guide for Windows'.

## Examples
For examples of how to use TEEHR, see the [examples](https://rtiinternational.github.io/teehr/user_guide/index.html).  We will maintain a basic set of example Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating how to use the TEEHR tools.

## Resources
In May of 2023 we put on a workshop at the CIROH 1st Annual Training and Developers Conference.  The workshop materials and presentation are available in the workshop GitHub repository: [teehr-may-2023-workshop](https://github.com/RTIInternational/teehr-may-2023-workshop).  This workshop was based on version 0.1.0.

## Versioning
The TEEHR project follows semantic versioning as described here: [https://semver.org/](https://semver.org/).
Note, per the specification, "Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything MAY change at any time. The public API SHOULD NOT be considered stable.".  We are solidly in "major version zero" territory, and trying to move fast, so expect breaking changes often.
