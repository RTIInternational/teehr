    "# Introduction\n",
    "TEEHR enables conducting an exploratory evaluation through the concept of an Evaluation.  In this context an Evaluation is a class in Python and a directory with a defined set of subdirectories to hold all the relevant data that work together to make up an Evaluation, while the Evaluation class provides users with methods to interact with the data that is in the Evaluation directory. These interactions include fetching data from external sources, loading data that you already have, and querying and visualizing data that is in the Evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workbook we will walk though the structure of an Evaluation directory by using the Evaluation class to create a new Evaluation and explore its contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we will import the TEEHR class and use it to create a new Evaluation in the user's Home directory in a temp folder.  Feel free to change this location if you are following along.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note, if you want to follow along you will need to either have access to TEEHR-HUB or create a virtual enviroment and install TEEHR locally."
